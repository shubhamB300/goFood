# 🍔 goFood - Online Food Ordering Website

**goFood** is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to browse food items, add them to a cart, place orders, and view their order history — all within a smooth single-page experience.

> 🛠️ This project was built as part of my **college project** and is also the **first project** I developed while learning the **MERN stack**. It helped me understand the fundamentals of full-stack development and apply my skills in a real-world scenario.
